Prerequisites
.NET 6 SDK or later

Visual Studio 2022 with the ASP.NET and web development workload

SQL Server Express or any other SQL Server instance

1. Database Setup
Configure Connection String: Open the appsettings.json file in the PickYourTrip.API project. Make sure the DefaultConnection string points to your local SQL Server instance.

Run Database Migrations: Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio (View > Other Windows > Package Manager Console). Then, run the following command to create and update your database schema:

Update-Database -Project PickYourTrip.DataAccess -StartupProject PickYourTrip.API

2. Running the Application
Set Startup Projects: In Visual Studio's Solution Explorer, right-click the Solution and select "Configure Startup Projects...".

Creating an Admin User
Register a New User: Use the "Login" button and then the "Register" link to create a new account.

Update Role in Database:

Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to your database.

Find the dbo.Users table.

Locate the user you just created and change their Role column from "User" to "Admin".

Log In as Admin: You can now log in with that user's credentials to see the "Admin" button and access the dashboard.
